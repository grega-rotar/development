## Summary
In September 2023, Simon Premk and I embarked on a project to generate electricity using indoor bikes. Our journey began with the successful adaptation of an old washing machine electric motor to generate power. Over time, the project expanded in complexity, incorporating high-end technologies for real-time data monitoring accessible through a specifically designed website.
