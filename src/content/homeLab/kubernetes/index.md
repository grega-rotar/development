#### Summary:
In September 2023, **Simon Premk and Grega Rotar** embarked on a groundbreaking project to design and build a stationary bike that generates electricity. What started as a DIY endeavor quickly evolved into an innovative solution at the intersection of indoor cycling and renewable energy. Their shared enthusiasm for the idea fueled their journey, leading them to explore the realms of engineering, programming, and sustainable technology.

#### Key Features:
- **Dual Passion:** Their mutual interest in cycling and renewable energy inspired the project, driving them to create a solution that merges these two fields seamlessly.
- **Innovative Design:** While initially planning to construct the bike frame from scratch, a stroke of luck spared them the need as they stumbled upon an existing frame. This allowed them to focus on integrating the electrical components efficiently.
- **Autonomous Approach:** Leveraging their individual skills, including programming expertise, they adopted a highly independent approach to the project, ensuring a thorough understanding of every aspect.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** By sourcing and repurposing components from their existing inventory, they minimized costs and maximized resource utilization, aligning with principles of sustainability.
- **Utilizing Spare Energy:** Addressing the energy wastage common in traditional stationary bikes, their solution aims to capture and convert this surplus energy into a usable form, enhancing the efficiency of indoor cycling sessions.

#### Context:
The project emerged against the backdrop of two prevalent themes: the global discourse on energy generation and the peak popularity of cycling in Slovenia. By bridging these domains, they aimed to offer a novel solution that not only promotes physical fitness but also contributes to the sustainable energy ecosystem.

#### Impact:
The potential of their energy-generating stationary bike extends beyond individual fitness routines. Much like a mobile phone, a ubiquitous device in modern life, these bikes could serve as decentralized power sources, capable of charging multiple devices simultaneously. Imagine the collective impact of a family's workout session powering their entire array of gadgets!

#### Conclusion:
Simon and Grega's project signifies a convergence of innovation, sustainability, and fitness. By harnessing the latent energy in indoor cycling, they aspire to redefine the way people perceive stationary bikes, transforming them from mere exercise machines into active contributors to the energy transition.
